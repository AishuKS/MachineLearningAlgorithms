## Introduction

Machine learning is a fascinating field with a wide range of algorithms and techniques used for data analysis, prediction, and decision making. This repository serves as a learning resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners to explore and understand different machine learning algorithms.

Each algorithm implementation includes detailed explanations, code examples, and references to further readings. Whether you're interested in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or deep learning, you'll find something here to deepen your understanding and improve your skills.

## Algorithms Included

- [x] Decision Trees
- [x] Support Vector Machines (SVM)


## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook within the repository. To use any specific algorithm, simply navigate to its corresponding file and follow the instructions provided in the comments.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-algorithms.git

# Navigate to the algorithm of interest
cd machine-learning-algorithms

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
